The document for understanding Inverter Protocol's Technical Specifications
Introduction 
The absence of modular and flexible building blocks for resource flow coordination protocols between multiple parties creates significant challenges for builders of decentralized coordination systems. Builders must struggle with complex interactions and relationships that abstract away these complexities from users without falling back to centralization tendencies. Nevertheless, these inflexible systems cannot accommodate an ever-evolving complexity and adaptability to future use cases. Such inefficiencies, elevated risks, and hindered innovation ultimately limit the potential impact and widespread adoption of decentralized technologies that could revolutionize industries and scale coordination.
Inverter Protocol is a decentralized coordination protocol that enables programmable asset flows between parties. The protocol is designed to support any project or use case that requires the exchange of resources between multiple parties while ensuring openness, adaptability, and ease of use. At its core, the Inverter Protocol consists of a modular architecture that seamlessly integrates different modules and existing protocols. This modular approach enables developers to create new modules that can be added to the protocol, allowing for an ever-expanding range of use cases and applications. 
Inverter Protocol is built on top of Ethereum and leverages the latest standards and best practices in smart contract development. The protocol uses EIP-1167-based proxies for deploying new contracts, ensuring a gas-efficient and cost-effective solution. One of the key benefits of Inverter Protocol is its focus on security. The protocol comprises audited and community-accepted modules that have been tested, audited, and proven to work.
While Inverter was initially conceived as a dynamic funding protocol for projects and contributors with multiple funders, it has evolved to become much more than that. It is now a programmable resource flow that can be used in a wide variety of use cases, from conditioned payment streams over dynamic staking mechanisms to fully-fledged protocols
